Data preprocessing, including handling missing values and converting dates for temporal analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns in review ratings, yearly trends, and sentiment distribution.
Visualizations such as bar plots, star rating distributions, and word clouds to provide insights.
Sentiment analysis based on star ratings to classify reviews as positive, neutral, or negative.
